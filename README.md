Project Plan: Next.js Jobs Portal MVP
This document outlines the step-by-step project plan for developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Next.js Jobs Portal. The plan is broken down into six sprints, designed for a small development team (2-3 developers), covering the entire lifecycle from setup to deployment.

Project Timeline Summary
Total Estimated Duration: 8 Weeks

Sprint 0: Foundation & Setup: 1 Week

Sprint 1: User Authentication: 1 Week

Sprint 2: Employer Features - Job Management: 2 Weeks

Sprint 3: Job Seeker Features - Job Discovery: 2 Weeks

Sprint 4: User Dashboards & Profiles: 1 Week

Sprint 5: Testing, Optimization & Deployment: 1 Week

Sprint 0: Foundation & Setup
Duration: 1 Week

Goal: To establish the project's technical foundation, configure development tools, and set up the initial application structure.

Key Tasks & User Stories:

Backend:

Set up MongoDB Atlas database.

Define initial database schemas for User, Job, and Application models using Mongoose or a similar ODM.

Frontend:

Create basic UI layout components (e.g., Header, Footer, Layout).

Design a simple, reusable Button component.

General/DevOps:

Initialize a new Next.js project.

Set up a Git repository on GitHub/GitLab.

Integrate and configure Tailwind CSS.

Install and configure NextAuth.js with the Email provider.

Set up environment variables (.env.local) for database connection strings, API keys, and NEXTAUTH_SECRET.

Deploy the initial empty shell to Vercel to establish the CI/CD pipeline.

Deliverables:

A live, empty Next.js application deployed on a Vercel staging URL.

A configured Git repository with a protected main branch.

Established database connection and defined data models.

A basic, unstyled application layout.

Sprint 1: User Authentication
Duration: 1 Week

Goal: To implement a complete and secure user registration and login flow for both Job Seekers and Employers.

Key Tasks & User Stories:

Backend:

Implement the API route for user registration (/api/auth/register).

Implement the logic to handle user sign-in and session creation using NextAuth.js.

Extend the User schema to include a role field ('Job Seeker' vs. 'Employer').

Frontend:

User Story: "As a new user, I can register for an account using my email and a password, and I must select whether I am a 'Job Seeker' or an 'Employer'."

User Story: "As an existing user, I can log in with my credentials."

User Story: "As a logged-in user, I can see my status and a 'Logout' button in the navigation bar."

Create the UI for the Registration and Login pages.

Implement form validation and error handling for both forms.

Create protected routes/pages that are only accessible to authenticated users.

Deliverables:

Functional user registration and login system.

Users are assigned a role upon registration.

A persistent user session managed by NextAuth.js.

UI components for all authentication forms.

Sprint 2: Employer Features - Job Management
Duration: 2 Weeks

Goal: To empower employers to create, view, and manage their job listings.

Key Tasks & User Stories:

Backend:

Create API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Jobs.

Implement middleware/route protection to ensure only authenticated Employers can create or modify jobs.

Associate created jobs with the employer's userId.

Frontend:

User Story: "As an Employer, I can access a dashboard to see all the jobs I have posted."

User Story: "As an Employer, I can create a new job posting through a dedicated form."

A "Post a Job" page with a rich form.

An Employer Dashboard listing all jobs they have created.

Sprint 3: Job Seeker Features - Job Discovery
Duration: 2 Weeks

Goal: To enable job seekers to find and view relevant job opportunities.

Key Tasks & User Stories:

Backend:

Create a public API endpoint to fetch and list all active job postings.

Implement server-side search and filtering logic (by keyword, location, job type).

Create an API endpoint to fetch the full details of a single job.

Frontend:

User Story: "As any user (guest or logged-in), I can view a list of all available jobs on the homepage or a dedicated 'Jobs' page."

User Story: "As a Job Seeker, I can search for jobs using keywords."

User Story: "As a Job Seeker, I can filter jobs by location and job type."

User Story: "As a Job Seeker, I can click on a job to view its full details on a separate page."

Develop the main job listings page with search and filter controls.

Create the individual job detail page, ensuring it's server-side rendered (SSR) for SEO benefits.
