# 🔒 Security Notice

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Environment Variables Security**

This project uses sensitive environment variables that should **NEVER** be committed to version control.

### 🚫 **What NOT to Commit:**

- Real MongoDB connection strings
- Production API keys
- NextAuth secrets
- Email server credentials
- Any passwords or tokens

### ✅ **What TO Do:**

1. **Use .env.local for development**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your actual credentials
   ```

2. **Keep .env.local private**:
   - Never commit .env.local to Git
   - Don't share it in chat/email
   - Don't include it in screenshots

3. **Use placeholders in documentation**:
   ```env
   # ❌ DON'T DO THIS
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://realuser:realpass@cluster.mongodb.net/

   # ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
   ```

### 🛡️ **Security Best Practices:**

#### **For Development:**
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Enable 2FA on MongoDB Atlas and other services
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Use different credentials for dev/staging/production

#### **For Production:**
- Use environment variables in deployment platform
- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Monitor for exposed credentials in logs

#### **For Team Collaboration:**
- Share credentials through secure channels (1Password, etc.)
- Document which services need credentials
- Use service accounts instead of personal accounts
- Implement least-privilege access

### 🔍 **How to Check for Exposed Secrets:**

1. **Before committing**:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached | grep -i "mongodb\|password\|secret\|key"
   ```

2. **Scan existing commits**:
   ```bash
   git log --all --grep="password\|secret\|key" -i
   ```

3. **Use tools like**:
   - GitLeaks
   - TruffleHog
   - GitHub Secret Scanning

### 🚨 **If Credentials Are Accidentally Exposed:**

1. **Immediately rotate all exposed credentials**
2. **Remove from Git history** (if possible)
3. **Check access logs** for unauthorized usage
4. **Update all team members**
5. **Review security practices**

### 📋 **Environment Setup Checklist:**

- [ ] Copied .env.example to .env.local
- [ ] Updated all placeholder values with real credentials
- [ ] Verified .env.local is in .gitignore
- [ ] Tested application with new credentials
- [ ] Documented any additional required setup

### 🎓 **For Students/Trainees:**

- Always use your own MongoDB Atlas account
- Create separate clusters for different projects
- Never share your credentials with classmates
- Ask instructors for help with setup, not credentials

### 📞 **Need Help?**

If you accidentally commit sensitive data:
1. Contact your team lead immediately
2. Rotate the exposed credentials
3. Follow your organization's incident response procedure
